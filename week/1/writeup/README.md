### Part 2 (75 pts)

If I was auditing my company and found a complex security problem in the firmware, I would immediately alert my boss of the vulnerability. I would explain in detail the risks of not remediating the vulnerability and the resources that would be required to fix the problem. If my boss will not listen, I will include my teammates on the issue and see if they can stress the urgency to remediate this problem.  If my boss still will not listen, I will consider attempting to contact my boss's superior to give him a cost risk analysis to show him that the money spent remediating the vulnerability would be less than the amount of money from potential lawsuits, should the vulnerability be exploited.  If management still will not do anything about the vulnerability, I will suggest that some compensating controls be put in place to make the security problem more difficult to exploit. If the company is not willing to postpone the release, I will make sure I have email records documenting that management was aware of the inherent risk and did nothing. I believe that going public about the complex security problem will not be the best thing to do in this scenario because the vulnerability can be quickly exploited and immediately danger the occupants.  I do believe that a developer is partially responsible for a security problem if they are aware of the vulnerability and do nothing to remediate it.
