## Assignment 10 Writeup   

### Part 1 (70 Pts)   
I knew that I would need to use SQL injection for this part, but I did not see any input fields.  I figured that database queries were being run with the id parameter in the url.  I began experimenting with differnt injections and I was able to return the entire database with the command ```/item?id=0' or '1=1```  

The flag that I found was ```CMSC38R-{y0U-are_the_5ql_n1nja}```  
  
### Part 2 (30 Pts)
